# String Calculator Kata

here is my string calculator.
It first verifies that there are no negative numbers --> as soon as it encounters a minus sign("-"), it will return the sentence "Negatives are not allowed" --> the only condition of the kata I could not satisfy is to visualize multiple negative numbers...not sure how I can modify my code to allow this...
If the string does not contain negative numbers, the code splits a string and then filters it to only numbers.
Finally, all numbers are added one to the other.

**CODE SUBMISSION:** Add the code to your own Github account and send us the link.
